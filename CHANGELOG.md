# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First public version.

- Catalog of `@extract`, `@fn`, `@check` (soft and hard) and `@rule` parts; contracts come from function signatures.
- Typed questions (yes/no, choice); the strategist plans only the parts the asked questions need, plus checkpoints.
- Answers with confidence, a quote or a formula, and a hash-chained trace that `replay` re-verifies.
- Early exit (hard checks first; a failed one skips what only the settled questions needed) and parallel execution of
  independent steps (`workers=`), with a scheduling-independent trace.
- Learning: answer heads from labeled examples (`fit`), readable rule lists (`learn_rule`), Platt calibration (`calibrate`).
- ModernBERT extractors: one-pass multi-field (`MultiSpanExtractor`), per-field QA (`SpanExtractor`), long documents by field
  description with "no answer" (`LongSpanExtractor`), save/load and Hugging Face loading.

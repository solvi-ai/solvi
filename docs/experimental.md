# Experimental

`solvi.experimental` holds pieces that work and are tested but have not yet shown a measured gain, or a measured use,
of the kind the rest of solvi promises. Their API may change in any release. Each one either graduates or is removed by
**1.2** (two minor releases after 1.0).

```python
from solvi.experimental import STATUS
STATUS["lora"]       # {"since": "0.7", "what": "...", "missing": "...", "script": None, "deadline": "1.2"}
```

How you can tell you are using one:

- importing it warns once with a `solvi.ExperimentalWarning` (a `UserWarning`; silence it with
  `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=solvi.ExperimentalWarning)`);
- a decision made by a System that uses one records it in the stored decision (`meta["experimental"]`, e.g.
  `["lora"]`), and `solvi report --overview` counts those decisions;
- nothing stable imports them, and `solvi` does not re-export them. One command loads one when you ask for it:
  `solvi hook` (hooks).

**Graduating** needs a bar fixed before the measurement, a script in `benchmarks/` that measures it, the bar met and
independently reviewed, no import of anything experimental, a conformance check, and a docs move; the old path then
keeps working for one release. **Removal**: a piece that has not graduated by its deadline, or that measures negative,
is removed and the negative result published.

Each section below gives the piece's `STATUS` entry: what it is, since when it exists, what it is missing to graduate,
the script that measures it (`changes`, `laws`, `skills`) and where the guide describes it.

## `lora`

A LoRA adapter on the decider for one question (`solvi.experimental.lora.adapt_lora(part, examples)`; was
`part.adapt_lora(...)`; needs `solvi[lora]`). Since 0.7.

- **Missing:** a decision on real use, a benchmark script in the repo, and wiring as the adapter rung of an update (solvi.experimental.changes); measured gains over fit come with overconfidence.
- **Script:** none yet. **Deadline:** 1.2.
- Guide: [A LoRA adapter per question](guide.md#a-lora-adapter-per-question-adapt_lora-experimental);
  API: [solvi.experimental.lora](api/lora.md).

## `compile`

A written specification compiled by an LLM into catalog parts, accepted when two drafts agree and the specification's
tests pass (with its sandbox, `solvi.experimental.compile.sandbox`). Since 0.9. Since 1.1 an optional certificate on fresh examples sized by the hypothesis space (`certificate=`, `fresh_examples_needed`, `skew_guard`).

- **Missing:** acceptance on larger specifications and a benchmark script in benchmarks/.
- **Script:** none yet. **Deadline:** 1.2.
- Guide: [A specification compiled into the catalog](guide.md#a-specification-compiled-into-the-catalog-solviexperimentalcompile);
  API: [solvi.experimental.compile](api/compile.md), [sandbox](api/sandbox.md).

## `hooks`

`solvi hook`: a coding agent's pre-edit rule checks and skill picker (Claude Code; Codex built from its documented
hook schema). Since 0.7.1.

- **Missing:** false deny and ask rates on real coding-agent sessions, with a script.
- **Script:** none yet. **Deadline:** 1.2.
- Guide: [solvi behind a coding agent's hooks](guide.md#solvi-behind-a-coding-agents-hooks);
  API: [solvi.experimental.hooks](api/hooks.md); runnable: `examples/22_coding_agent_hooks.py`.

## `charts`

Verified charts: every number quoted from the text, a deterministic SVG. Since 0.7.

- **Missing:** accuracy on real texts with the rule-based and the LLM proposer.
- **Script:** none yet. **Deadline:** 1.2.
- Guide: [Verified charts](guide.md#verified-charts-a-specialist-that-checks-every-number);
  API: [solvi.experimental.charts](api/charts.md); runnable: `examples/21_verified_chart.py`.

## `changes`

One change pipeline for four sources (a document version, verified experience, a person's correction, a search
proposal): pluggable stages, a journal of kind "change", promote into the knowledge store / compiled versions / a
labelled update (`LearningTarget`: the update ladder and its gates, which were the learning loop's until 1.1), versions
and rollback (`solvi.experimental.changes.Pipeline(stages, storage, store=...)`). Since 1.1.

- **Missing:** on a credit policy the pipeline carried a document version (144 of 144 changed decisions traced to their clause), admitted 12 of 12 exact exceptions, held every widening one for a person and refused 8 of 8 exceptions that touched other decisions, 0 extraneous changes, 14 versions replayed; on a bank-request stream with a person's labels every one of 22 candidates passed every stage (`nogate` = `gate`), so the stages added nothing there — the module is journal, impact analysis, approval levels and rollback; still missing: the narrows / widens classifier over rule conditions, a regression-scenario stage, and a script for the bank-request stream (the credit numbers: benchmarks/changes_credit.py).
- **Script:** `benchmarks/changes_credit.py` (the credit policy; needs the German Credit applications:
  `benchmarks/tasks/fetch.sh credit` and `prepare.py`). **Deadline:** 1.2.
- Guide: [The change pipeline](guide.md#the-change-pipeline-solviexperimentalchanges); design and API: the module
  docstring of `solvi.experimental.changes`; the library pieces it uses are stable:
  sensitive fields and citations in [solvi check](guide.md#checking-a-catalog-solvi-check), `only=` in
  [solvi diff](guide.md#catalog-fingerprint-solvi-diff-and-shadow-mode).

## `laws`

Laws of an environment from prediction mismatches, judged by the environment, never by a model
(`solvi.experimental.laws`): a grammar of boolean atoms you write, candidates "for this action, under this condition,
the effect is this" from each wrong prediction, acceptance only by a held-out test on other worlds, sessions or paths,
most specific first, retirement when the held-out precision falls, a probe planner for live systems (`split`,
`discriminate`: read-only before write) and export into the knowledge store (`LawSet.to_knowledge`). Since 1.1.

- **Missing:** on a game simulator with written mechanics the laws closed 94% of the gap between a learned map and the written mechanics, but random candidates under the same test came within 1.1 points, so the mismatch is a compact proposal heuristic and the test does the work; on a real MCP filesystem server with a path policy, probes planned from mismatches took refusals from 6 to 0 in one session (random probes: 48 to 29); still missing: a grammar too large to enumerate, retirement of weak laws nothing contradicts, wiring into a System's decisions, and a script for the two stands (the toys: benchmarks/laws_toy.py).
- **Script:** `benchmarks/laws_toy.py` (two deterministic toys that reproduce both findings in miniature; `pytest -m
  slow tests/test_laws_toy.py`). **Deadline:** 1.2.
- Guide: [Laws from an environment](best_practices.md#laws-from-an-environment-the-test-is-the-judge); API:
  [solvi.experimental.laws](api/laws.md).

## `skills`

Learning in a world described by code (`solvi.experimental.skills`): System 2 plans on an exact model of the world (a
copy of the environment; the real one is never stepped by the planner), a plan counts only after the code re-simulated
it, verified plans are compiled into System 1 skills ("when these atoms hold, for this goal, do this sequence"; the
conditions keep the atoms every verified start shared), and a skill acts alone only while its outcomes keep an
anytime-valid certificate — before that System 2 re-verifies it at every use, and an alarm on its alone outcomes
retires it. `SkillLearner` runs the loop with a record per decision and per episode; `as_s2(learner)` makes the planner
System 2 of `solvi.Agent`; `SkillSet.to_knowledge` writes the skills into the knowledge store. Since 1.1.

- **Missing:** on a deterministic gridworld (20 fresh layouts, five seeds) System 1's share reached 0.81 in the last five episodes with every goal reached, as when System 2 plans every goal, and 1.5% of System 1's decisions were in failed runs under a 20% promise pooled over the skills, while replayed cases never transferred and plans compiled without verification reached no goal; still missing: a stand beyond the toy (a game simulator with written mechanics, a service with a specification), a 5% promise (fifty clean uses per certified unit), a condition rule that specialises after a failure, and a planner with a heuristic.
- **Script:** `benchmarks/skills_toy.py` (the gridworld with four arms: skills, plan always, cases, scrambled; `pytest -m
  slow tests/test_skills_toy.py`). **Deadline:** 1.2.
- Guide: [Learning in a world described by code](best_practices.md#learning-in-a-world-described-by-code-plan-on-the-code);
  API: [solvi.experimental.skills](api/skills.md).

## Graduated and removed

- **Graduated in 1.1:** `counterfactual` — counterfactual explanations are the stable `solvi.core.explain`
  ([guide](guide.md#explaining-a-decision-the-smallest-change-that-flips-it)), with the cost of a text change a
  parameter (`text_cost=`, `costs=`); `solvi.experimental.counterfactual` re-exports it, with this warning, until 1.2.
- **Graduated in 1.1:** `mcp` — the MCP proxy with a guard is `solvi.serve`'s (`run_proxy`, `Proxy`, `Upstream`;
  [guide](guide.md#an-mcp-proxy)); `solvi.experimental.mcp` re-exports it, with this warning, until 1.2.
- **Graduated in 1.1:** `specialist` — the specialist contract is the stable `solvi.core.specialist`, its runs stored
  as records of kind "specialist" in a TraceStorage ([guide](guide.md#specialists-a-model-proposes-code-checks-the-store-keeps-the-run));
  `solvi.experimental.specialist` re-exports it, with this warning, until 1.2.
- **1.1:** `oncalib` (recalibrating a guarantee on the fly from outcomes: it broke the promise — recalibrate explicitly,
  `System.guarantee(..., corrections=True)`, on a schedule or after a drift flag) and `learning` (the learning loop: no
  measurable gain on streams of one kind of decision; a labelled update is now a candidate change of
  `solvi.experimental.changes`, `Change(artifact="update")` with `LearningTarget`). The changelog's 1.1 "Removed" table
  says why and what to use instead.

## Tried and left out

Some ideas were measured and did not make it into solvi, experimental or not; the
[changelog](../CHANGELOG.md#tried-and-left-out) lists them with what was measured.

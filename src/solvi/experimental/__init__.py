"""solvi.experimental — pieces that work and are tested but have not yet shown a measured gain (or a measured use) that
the rest of solvi promises. Their API may change in any release, and each one either graduates or is removed by its
deadline.

    from solvi.experimental import STATUS
    STATUS["lora"]       # {"since": "0.7", "missing": "...", "script": None, "deadline": "1.2"}

What marks them:

- importing one warns once (`solvi.ExperimentalWarning`, a UserWarning: silence it with
  `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=solvi.ExperimentalWarning)`);
- a decision made by a System that uses one records it: `meta["experimental"]` in the stored decision (the names, e.g.
  `["lora"]`), and the system report counts them;
- nothing stable imports them, and the top-level `solvi` package does not re-export them. One command-line entry loads
  one on request: `solvi hook` (hooks).

Graduating needs a pre-registered bar, a script in `benchmarks/` that measures it, the bar met and reviewed, no import
of anything experimental, a conformance check and a docs move; the old path is then kept for one release. A piece that
does not graduate by its deadline (two minor releases after 1.0), or that measures negative, is removed and the negative
result published.

This package itself imports none of them: `import solvi.experimental` does not warn."""
